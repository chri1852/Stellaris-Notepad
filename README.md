# Stellaris-Notepad
This is a small unfinished webapp built using angularjs and node. It was originally going to be used to help keep track of terraforming projects in the Paradox Interactive game Stellaris, but they have changed how this mechanic works, and this is now useless. This was some of my first angular code, so forgive bad design. Don't even get me started on how the css looks, I know thats bad.

To run open the server.bat, and then navigate in a web browser to http://localhost:9789/
